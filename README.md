# Github Search Made Easy

Github is one of the world's leading software software development platform used by individuals/teams to work through problems,share ideas and move ahead. Being a popular platform among the developer world, it supports various different programming languages and projects and is considered one of the biggest repositiories of code.  Naturally, such a huge code base requires a comprehensive and advanced searching feature to find projects, projects and more to support and promote the Github open source community. And Github provides this with it's advanced searcH.
However, what about those who are realtively new to coding or to the the concept of open-source? As mentioned in the talks given by the the mentors and keynote speakers, it is usually the first step which scares a new open source developer. No proper knowledge about Github or is it's usage or not knowing where to start is the biggest hurdle in their path. For them, the basic search on the nav-bar is not enough to find them the projects which they can work on and the advanced search is just too complex. (I must confess, even we did not ever use the advanced search to its full potenital for searching for issues,projects or code inpite of being developers for years!)
With this project, we aim at bridging this gap. We are concerned with those class of people who are looking for a start in the open source world.
With Github search, we provide just the right amount information and input options that a newbie would need. With the help of R shiny, we build a web-app around the Github API with restricting the some of the search parameters in impliciltly in our web app's back end.
